## 3D Printed Parts (CAD Files)

This folder contains the STL files for all custom 3D‑printed parts used in the car build.  
Each part has its STL file and a reference photo of the real‑life assembly.

### Front Bumper & Ultrasonic Sensor Case
Mounted at the front of the car to hold and protect the ultrasonic sensor.

Note: The CAD files for the **front bumper**, **ultrasonic sensor case**, and **encoder mount** were originally designed by the group from whom we inherited the car, **TurboSLAM**.
