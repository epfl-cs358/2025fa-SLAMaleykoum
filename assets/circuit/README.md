## Quick Recap

This diagram represents the electrical circuit of our project.  
The colors mostly match the real car wiring, with a few adjustments made for clarity and visibility.

### Adjustements: 
- **ESP-to-ESP communication cables** are shown in pink/blue (real life: black) to avoid confusion with ground.  
- **ESC PWM to ESP2 pin 15** is shown in grey (real life: white) to make it stand out clearly.
