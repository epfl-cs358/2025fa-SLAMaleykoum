/**
 * @file EncoderCarVelocity.h
 * @brief Interface for measuring car velocity and position using AS5600 magnetic encoder.
 * 
 * This class provides methods to read motor and wheel angular/linear velocities,
 * as well as cumulative distance traveled. It interfaces with the AS5600 encoder
 * via I2C and accounts for gear ratio and wheel dimensions.
 * 
 * @note Requires the AS5600 library (https://github.com/RobTillaart/AS5600) and I2C_wire configuration.
 * @note getDistance() must be called at 100+ Hz for accurate cumulative position tracking.
